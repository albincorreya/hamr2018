# Bonjour Makam

In this project, we created a tool that allows an user to upload a Turkish Makam music track and automatically get the information regarding the Makam used in this track. Furthermore, the application calculates the melodic similarity of the uploaded track to the musics present in the Ottoman-Turkish Makam Dataset and recomends tracks that use the same or similar Makams.


## Setup
